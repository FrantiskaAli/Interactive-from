# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive card details form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## Overview

I believe I have managed to meet all the criteria of the challenge. 

Users are be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process
I started by creating basic html layout which I have styled after, then I added all the functionality and ended with doing media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- jQuery


### What I learned
The most beneficial thing for me was once again practising input error messages looping. Also I am glad I used jQuery instead of just plain JS so I refreshed my recently gained bootcamp skill.
